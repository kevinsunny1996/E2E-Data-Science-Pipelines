Overview
========

Welcome to Astronomer! This project was generated after you ran 'astro dev init' using the Astronomer CLI. This readme describes the contents of the project, as well as how to run Apache Airflow on your local machine.

Project Contents
================

Your Astro project contains the following files and folders:

- dags: This folder contains the Python files for your Airflow DAGs. By default, this directory includes two example DAGs:
    - `example_dag_basic`: This DAG shows a simple ETL data pipeline example with three TaskFlow API tasks that run daily.
    - `example_dag_advanced`: This advanced DAG showcases a variety of Airflow features like branching, Jinja templates, task groups and several Airflow operators.
- Dockerfile: This file contains a versioned Astro Runtime Docker image that provides a differentiated Airflow experience. If you want to execute other commands or overrides at runtime, specify them here.
- include: This folder contains any additional files that you want to include as part of your project. It is empty by default.
- packages.txt: Install OS-level packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
- requirements.txt: Install Python packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
- plugins: Add custom or community plugins for your project to this file. It is empty by default.
- airflow_settings.yaml: Use this local-only file to specify Airflow Connections, Variables, and Pools instead of entering them in the Airflow UI as you develop DAGs in this project.

Deploy Your Project Locally
===========================

1. Start Airflow on your local machine by running 'astro dev start'.

This command will spin up 4 Docker containers on your machine, each for a different Airflow component:

- Postgres: Airflow's Metadata Database
- Webserver: The Airflow component responsible for rendering the Airflow UI
- Scheduler: The Airflow component responsible for monitoring and triggering tasks
- Triggerer: The Airflow component responsible for triggering deferred tasks

2. Verify that all 4 Docker containers were created by running 'docker ps'.

Note: Running 'astro dev start' will start your project with the Airflow Webserver exposed at port 8080 and Postgres exposed at port 5432. If you already have either of those ports allocated, you can either [stop your existing Docker containers or change the port](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/test-and-troubleshoot-locally#ports-are-not-available).

3. Access the Airflow UI for your local Airflow project. To do so, go to http://localhost:8080/ and log in with 'admin' for both your Username and Password.

You should also be able to access your Postgres Database at 'localhost:5432/postgres'.

4. Connection testing is [disabled by default](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/connections#:~:text=You%20can%20enable%20connection%20testing,Enabled%20in%20your%20Airflow%20environment.) , to do so , perform the following steps:
    1. Add the following command - `ENV AIRFLOW__CORE__TEST_CONNECTION=Enabled`  in the Dockerfile.
    2. Restart the setup by typing - `astro dev restart`

5. Post enabling connection testing , create a file in /include/gcp directory as service_account.json , add the download service account key details and add the file name to gitignore to avoid misuse.

6. Now add the following details as connections:
    1. Connection Id - gcp
    2. Connection Type - Google Cloud `Dropdown Selection`
    3. Description - Airflow Service Account connection
    4. For the **Keyfile Path** use the following command to get the path within the pod - `astro dev bash` and type pwd:
        1. Add the following value - /usr/local/airflow/include/gcp/service_account.json
    5. Click on Test and verify success and you're all set.
